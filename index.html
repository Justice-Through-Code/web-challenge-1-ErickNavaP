    <h1>My First Website!</h1>
        <p>On this website, I will have lists of my favorite foods. Some foods you might not recognize since they are <em>Mexican</em> dishes but others you will as they are popular foods. The Mexican dishes are ones that I grew up eating at home, made by the women in my family. The common foods on this list are ones that we ordered and ate at restaurants.</p>
        <p><strong><h4>Here is my first list:</h4></strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mole</li>
                <!--Mole is a traditional Mexican dish which is chocolatie spicy dark red gravy like sauce that goes over chicken and is served with red rice and tortillas.-->
                <li>Pizza</li>
                <li>Chicken Pad Thai</li>
            </ol>
        <p> These are the foods that have topped my list of favorite foods for the last 20 years. Of course there are also some runner up foods that can potentially be added to my favorite foods list.</p>
        <P><storng><h4>Here are the runner ups!</h4></storng></P>
            <ul>
                <li>Tortas</li>
                <!--A torta is a sandwhich like food that has beans, cheese, lettuce, and salsa, typically considered Mexican.-->
                <li>Lasagna</li>
                <li>Pozole</li>
            </ul>   
        <p>As I travel more around the world and try new cuisines, I hope to expand both lists above. Regardless if any other food makes it on my lists, I will keep enjoying the things I try and stay open to new and unique culinary experiences. </p>
        <p><h2><strong><em>THE END!</em></strong></h2></p>
